# gin-boilerplate
A starter project with Golang and Gin framework.

Quickstart web service integrates different tools you may need.
Don not worry about import too many redundant tools into the project that make project too bloated,
because the tools used are all in different git branches,
you can only merge/rebase the needed ones into the development branch.
