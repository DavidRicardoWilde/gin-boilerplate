# logger-boilerplate
A starter project with log.

Quickstart custom logger and integrate different tools you may need.
Do not worry about import too many redundant tools into the project that make project too bloated,
because the tools used are all in different git branches,
you can only merge/rebase the needed ones into the development branch.
